# ðŸŽ‰ Long ChÃ¢u PMS - Database Successfully Configured!

Your LC-PMS application is now fully connected to Neon PostgreSQL with all sample data loaded.

## âœ… Current Status
- **Database**: âœ… Connected to Neon PostgreSQL
- **Sample Data**: âœ… Loaded (3 users, 3 customers, 5 products, 2 prescriptions, 3 orders)
- **Real-time Data**: âœ… All operations now persist to database
- **Drizzle Studio**: âœ… Available at `npm run db:studio`

### Database Schema
The system uses Drizzle ORM with the following tables:
- `users` - Authentication and user management
- `customers` - Customer profiles and health information
- `products` - Pharmacy inventory
- `prescriptions` - Prescription management
- `orders` - Order processing
- `notifications` - User notifications
- `activity_logs` - System activity tracking
- `inventory_transactions` - Stock movement history

## ðŸ›  Development Commands

```bash
# Database operations
npm run db:generate    # Generate migration files
npm run db:push       # Apply schema to database
npm run db:studio     # Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:drop       # Drop database (use with caution)

# Application
npm run dev           # Start development server
npm run build         # Build for production
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. Verify your `.env` file has the correct `VITE_DATABASE_URL`
2. Ensure your Neon database is active (not paused)
3. Check that your connection string includes `?sslmode=require`

### Schema Issues
1. Run `npm run db:generate` to create new migrations
2. Run `npm run db:push` to apply changes to your database

### Data Migration
- The application automatically handles data synchronization
- Existing mock data can be migrated to the database
- All operations work offline and sync when connection is restored

## ðŸ“± User Experience

- **Seamless Operation**: Works with or without database connection
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes are immediately saved to the database
- **Connection Indicator**: Always shows current database status
- **Setup Guide**: Built-in setup assistant accessible via the sidebar

For more detailed setup instructions, visit the "Database Setup" page in the application sidebar.
